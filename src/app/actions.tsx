    Answer true or false in the "answer" field. And give a short text response that confirms or denies the user's answer in the "response" field, followed by an example emoji that matches the response.

    For example, "The emoji is not a flag ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸" or "The emoji is a face ðŸ¤ª". Do not start the response with "yes" or "no". Always start with "The emoji is..." Do not provide any text after the one-sentence response. The example emoji must never be the answer as ${emoji}. The example emoji must not be a hint at the answer.

    If the question is too abstract, not a yes or no question, or is not a question related to the game, answer false and respond with "This is an invalid question. Try again!"`,
